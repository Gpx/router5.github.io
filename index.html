        <h1>router5 is an HTML5 router, simple but powerful.</h1>

        <blockquote>It favours convention over configuration, and is library / framework agnostic.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>It plays nicely with modern component-based functional frameworks and libraries.</blockquote>
    </main>

    <section>
        <blockquote>Router5 is made of several building blocks, each of them embrace the
        <i>Single Responsability Principle</i>.</blockquote>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/troch/path-parser"><strong>path-parser</strong></a>

                PathParser is responsible for parsing paths into tokens (identifying segments, parameters, etc...) so
                it can match URL fragments or build them with supplied parameters.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/troch/route-node"><strong>route-node</strong></a>

                RouteNode organises routes in a tree of nested named routes with each of its branch being a valid route. It uses
                PathParser to quickly find a matching route in a tree, or to build a path from a route name and params.
            </li>

            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/troch/route-node"><strong>router5</strong></a>

                Finally, router5 is the last layer. It adds navigation and history functionalities, using RouteNode
                to store your application routes.
            </li>
        </ul>

            Helpers are being created for some specifi libraries and frameworks to help reduce boilerplate code.
