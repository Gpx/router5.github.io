# Get started

> _router5_ is available in all major formats: __ES6__, __AMD__, __CommonJS__, __globals__ and __UMD__.

It can be installed using __npm__ or __bower__. Alternatively, you can download a specific version
from [github](https://github.com/router5/router5/releases). Whether you install _router5_ from npm, bower or github,
you will have access to the same files.


## Installation

__Bower__

```sh
bower install router5
```

__npm__

```sh
npm install router5
```

## Include _router5_ in your application

__CommonJS / ES6__

Files are available in `/dist/commonjs/`.

```javascript
import { Router5, RouteNode } from 'router5';
```

__Browser (globals)__

`router5.js` and `router5.min.js` are available in `/dist/browser/`. All _router5_ dependencies (_route-node_ and _path-parser_)
are packaged together, and `Router5` and `RouteNode` are made globally available.

__AMD__

`router5.js` and `router5.min.js` are available in `/dist/amd/`, it includes all router5 dependencies bundled
together. `router5` returns an object containing `Router5` and `RouteNode`.

__UMD__

UMD files are available in `/dist/umd`.


## Plugins

> `router5-listeners` and `router5-history` are both available through npm and bower too.

```sh
# Listeners plugin
npm install router5-listeners
bower install router5-listeners

# History plugin
npm install router5-history
bower install router5-history
```

[router5-listeners](https://github.com/router5/router5-listeners) global bundle adds `router5ListenersPlugin` to the global scope. The AMD
bundle is named `router5ListenersPlugin`.

[router5-listeners](https://github.com/router5/router5-listeners) global bundle adds `router5ListenersPlugin` to the global scope. The AMD

<!-- __ES6__

_router5_ and its dependencies are written in ES6 and transpiled to ES5. If you wish to include ES6 sources directly
in your application, files are located in `/modules`. It is planned to release ES6 sources by default through __jspm__.

For now, ES6 sources can be accessed using `npm`.

```javascript
import {Router5, RouteNode} from 'router5/dist/es6'
```

__Univeral Module Loader__

The UMD format (accessible in `/dist/umd`) covers AMD, CommonJS and Globals.
